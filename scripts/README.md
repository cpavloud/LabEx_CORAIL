The analysis was done in several steps. 

**Step 1**

Since we were interested in specific Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW) provinces, the first step was to run 1_mregions.R to create the .wkt geometries of the MEOW regions and provinces of interest.

**Step 2**

Since the .wkt are too big, we need to run the 2_script_big_wkt.R to convert the .wkt to smaller boxes
